Hi there. A few years ago I moved from India to Canada to pursue higher education. Soon after I arrived, 
I realised how much I missed my mom's food and our various cooking adventures. Upon my request she started sending me 
little voice notes over WhatsApp for whichever dish I wished to make. It dawned upon me that this was the first time my mother 
was documenting the knowledge and techniques she had mastered over decades of taking care of our family. I wanted to preserve these
recipes and so started collecting them in a private group-chat, labelling them as I went. Eventually we amassed over two dozen recipes
and I started getting concerned about the integrity of this group-chat solution, for it was tied to a single
WhatsApp account, and if my account was lost so would all the recipes.
<br><br>
So here it is, MomsRecipes. A soft solution to preserve and access my moms recipes from anywhere. 
<br><br>
The app is built with Django for the backend and React.js in the front. Frontend hosted on Vercel, backend on Heroku, media on Cloudinary, and domain from Name.com. This is a fun project, very bare bones right now, but I'll continue working on it. 
<br><br>
The site is accessible at <a href="https://momsrecipes.rocks">www.momsrecipes.rocks</a> (I got this domain free ðŸ˜…)
<br><br>
Thanks for being here!
